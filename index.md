## 1 INTRODUCTION  :

Predicting the evolution of financial markets is often compared to “predicting the unpredictable” a challenge that reaches its peak with cryptocurrencies. Indeed, we are talking about high volatile market which can either make you rich or makes you lose everything.

Indeed, this year, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has been shaken by exceptional volatility, far exceeding that of traditional markets. From January 1 to October 29, 2024, the Bitcoin volatility index saw extreme peaks, much higher than those of 2023. Furthermore, the threat of a "bear market" appeared with bewildering speed.
* A bear market is a situation when the market goes down by 20% or more.

In fact, a cryptocurrency's price depends on a combination of factors to start and evolve: a supply (often limited), demand, and an underlying technology. But not all price movements are created equal.

### The "Ingredients" of a Market Movement :

* A Catalyst: This is anything that can generate sudden interest. Common catalysts are an announcement from the Federal Reserve (FED) or an ETF approval.
* Market Players: This is the available liquidity and general sentiment. Retail investors, investment funds, and "whales" (large wallets) are the typical drivers. The amount of "FOMO" (Fear of Missing Out) or "FUD" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) greatly affects how quickly a price evolves.
* Asset Nature: Certain assets, like "memecoins," are propelled by social media mechanisms and can react more quickly and intensely than established assets like Bitcoin.

### The Spread of the Movement:

Once a movement starts, it can spread rapidly depending on market sentiment and the structure of the order book.
* Social Media Sentiment: This is a key factor. The volume of mentions on X (Twitter) or Reddit is a critical element. Studies have shown that a rise in positive sentiment is linked to an increase in prices. Very high sentiment can suck up liquidity and cause prices to rise.
* Algorithmic Trading ("Bots"): The rapid interventions of high-frequency trading bots bring a new influx of orders (buy/sell) to the movement. They can also propagate cascading effects, triggering liquidations in the derivatives markets.
* Structure (Order Books): Prices tend to move faster uphill as they break through "sell walls" (resistance) than downhill. This acceleration is due to buying pressure forcing stop-loss orders located further up to be triggered, allowing them to be hit more easily.

### The Consequences:

These extreme market movements represent a major problem with diverse consequences:
* Economic Issues: Volatility can cause immense losses for unwary investors. In 2022, the collapse of several platforms destroyed billions of dollars in capital, ruining thousands of investors. These collapses disrupt economic activity by destroying confidence and freezing capital.
* Human Issues: Volatility causes immense human stress. Furthermore, the unregulated nature of the market fosters scams ("rug pulls") that target individuals. Exposure to this volatility is estimated to cause mental health problems for thousands of investors.

Faced with this continuous increase in volatility, questions arise: When will it stop? Can this risk at least be managed? And if so, what can we do? How can we better protect investors and minimize losses?
