## 1 INTRODUCTION  :

Predicting the evolution of financial markets is often compared to “predicting the unpredictable” a challenge that reaches its peak with cryptocurrencies. Indeed, we are talking about high volatile market which can either make you rich or makes you lose everything.

Indeed, this year, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has been shaken by exceptional volatility, far exceeding that of traditional markets. From January 1 to October 29, 2024, the Bitcoin volatility index saw extreme peaks, much higher than those of 2023. Furthermore, the threat of a "bear market" appeared with bewildering speed.
*A bear market is a situation when the market goes down by 20% or more.

In fact, a cryptocurrency's price depends on a combination of factors to start and evolve: a supply (often limited), demand, and an underlying technology. But not all price movements are created equal.
