### Title : CryptoForecast: A Time-Series Forecasting Prototype for Cryptocurrency Prices

### Proposal: : 
The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility, making price prediction particularly complex. This project aims to develop a prototype service (Option B)  that makes trend forecasting more accessible and understandable.

Our objective is to build a simple web application where a user can select a major cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The application will then display a chart of historical price data and a forecast for the upcoming days.

To achieve this, we will use an AI model specialized in time-series analysis, likely an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) recurrent neural network. This model will be trained on historical price data.

The focus will be on presenting the development steps and the integration of the AI technique, in line with the course requirements. The model's accuracy, while important, is not the final goal at this stage.
